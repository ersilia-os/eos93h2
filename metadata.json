    "Description": "Representation Learning Framework that utilizes molecule images for encoding molecular inputs as machine readable vectors for downstream tasks such as bio-activity prediction, drug metabolism analysis, or drug toxicity prediction. The approach utilizes transfer learning, that is, pre-training the model on massive unlabeled datasets to help it in generalizing feature extraction and then fine tuning on specific tasks. The is a regression model and will be fine tuned on top 10 GPCR datasets with the largest number of reported ligands from Chembel datasets.",
